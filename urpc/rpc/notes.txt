TODOs:
* 1-way RPCs
  - Ability to send back RPC to caller
* Client decides if RPC runs in separate goroutine?
* RPC Batching: send multiple RPCs to a destination with a single write syscall
  Will make a difference for AppendLog+UpdateCommitIndex, etc.

func OneWayExampleRPC(ctx *Context, args []byte) {
     // do whatever with args
     ctx.rpcBack(blah)
}

Explicit batching:
func ExampleBundledRPCs() {
     reqBatch := cl.Start()
     reqBatch.CallOneWay()
     reqBatch.Call()
     reqBatch.Finish()
}

Automatic batching:
Batch all RPCs that clients invoke while one is being sent into a next invocation.


Want better error handling.
E.g. something got disconnected while in replicated kv, and I have no idea why.
E.g. did a Send() fail, did a Receive() give an error, etc.
